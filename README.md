# TLE9879-BLDC-Shield







Arduino library for Infineon's [BLDC Shield with TLE9879](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/bldc_shield_tle9879/).

## Summary
The BLDC shield is a small evaluation board equipped with the TLE9879 to use with Arduino. Up to 4 boards can be stacked ontop of each other to control 4 BLDC motors indepedently. Each shield can supply up to 10 A load current. The implemented integrated [TLE9879](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/embedded-power-ics-system-on-chip-/3-phase-bridge-driver-integrated-arm-cortex-m3/)
is a inteligent B6 MOSFET driver designed especially for automotive motion control applications such as wiper, engine cooling fan or Fuel pump.
